            At the beginning of 2025, I made a commitment to myself that I would
            row 365 times before the end of the year. Along the way I've also
            been learning how to use the accessibility tool Talon Voice.

            It's been my goal that all changes to this website including
            interactions with git and GitHub happen well I'm rowing, or at the
            very least are done through voice interaction tools directly after
            I've completed a row.

            Sometimes I work on this actual website while I'm rowing, sometimes
            I watch educational videos or participate in groups like Virtual
            Coffee or #100Devs. I wouldn't say it's the most efficient process
            but it does keep me engaged throughout my exercise and also help me
            stay on top of tech news and keep in touch with it friends. It's
            been a hoot :)
